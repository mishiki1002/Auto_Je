# What is this for?
This repository is for the Kalamzoo public high schools autonomous. Every year we compete in a competition called [Square One](http://www.squareonenetwork.org/). Although Square One competes in multiple diffrent competitions, we specificly compete in the [Autonomous Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge](http://www.squareonenetwork.org/innovative-vehicle-design/autonomous-innovative-vehicle-design-challenge/) Each year the task's are diffrent but the goal is the same, To re engineer a power jeep. This year we used three arduinos, One for led ie brake lights & flood light's, We have a one for the speaks (Yes we have speakers, and their bluetooth). And lastly we have our main arduino wich is for all of our motors and sensors. This year we went with a traditional jeep design aswell as traditional steering. We are using the nine axis gyro with a sheild extender for our gps. Although we have the program for the gps it was not implemented because it takes up too much power.
